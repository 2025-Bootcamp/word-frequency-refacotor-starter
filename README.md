# 📘 Word Frequency Game - Homework Assignment

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to practice and master **code refactoring techniques** through a small, real-world inspired project. You are required to refactor a program that calculates word frequencies in a string, improving its **readability, maintainability, and structure** without changing its behavior.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes a main class `WordFrequencyGame` that counts the frequency of each word in a given input string and returns the results in descending order of frequency.

---

## ✅ Assignment Requirements

You are required to refactor the code in `WordFrequencyGame.java` to improve **readability, clarity, and testability**. Follow the guidelines below:

### 💡 Required Refactoring Techniques:

- ✅ Extract Method
- ✅ Rename Variable / Method (to meaningful and self-explanatory names)
- ✅ Eliminate Duplicate Code
- ✅ Replace Mysterious Names
- ✅ Inline Temporary Variables
- ✅ please use **Stream** api

### 🚫 Do NOT:

- ❌ Introduce design patterns (e.g., Strategy, Factory)
- ❌ Change the behavior or output format of the `getResult(String)` method
- ❌ Add logging, print statements, or database dependencies

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing (Provided)

Ensure that your refactored code **passes all test cases**.

- Test class: `WordFrequencyGameTest.java`
- How to run: Use your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) or command line to run the JUnit tests

---

## ✍️ Submission Requirements

1. Commit for each minor refactoring. 
2. Make sure `getResult(String)` behaves exactly the same as before.
3. All test cases must pass, and don't update the test cases.
4. Optional: Add comments to explain what refactorings you applied and why.

---

## 🧠 Reflection Questions (Optional)

- Which part of the original code was hardest to read? Why?
- What refactoring techniques did you use? What problems did they solve?
- How could this code be made more extensible (e.g., to support punctuation or case-insensitive counting)?

---

## 📅 Deadline

⏰ **Submit your assignment before 10:00 PM**, including the refactored code and a screenshot showing all tests pass.

---

If you need help, feel free to reach out to your instructor or TA.  
Happy refactoring!
